EBM-GO
-------

I built small ebook management library in Go called **EBM-GO**. It designed to be simple and minimal, 
supporting only the basics: importing, listing, and removing ebooks from your collection.

Think of it as a terminal-friendly alternative to Calibre, but stripped down to just essentials.

Why I Made this
----------------

I spend most of my time in the terminal. It's where i feel most productive, and I wanted a way to manage ebooks
directly from there - without needing to open a separate GUI application.

Instead of clicking through menus to edit ebook metadata, I prefer editing it directly in my text editor.
This project makes workflow possible.

Who Is This Book For?
---------------------

If you:
* Prefer the command line.
* Use tools like vim, less, fzf.
* Like management your digital library in Unix way.
 
Then you might enjoy EBM-Go as much as i do.
