Introduction
------------

This blog is a small corner of the web where I’ll be sharing my thoughts, 
experiences, and ideas. It’s intentionally simple, intentionally quiet — no clutter, 
no distractions.

I've always believed that the web doesn’t need to be complicated. 
So, rather than using an off-the-shelf platform filled with unnecessary features, 
I decided to build this site myself, from scratch, using tools I trust and understand.

Why am I doing this? Well, it’s more fun this way, and it gives me a lot more knowledge
than using another bloated framework or library just to make a simple blog.


Sharing Things I Care About
---------------------------

Over time, I hope to fill this blog with:
* Thoughts on software development.
* Notes on tools I enjoy.
* Occasional reflections on life, work, and learning.

I’m not chasing clicks or followers here. I simply want to document what I’ve 
learned and maybe, just maybe, it’ll help someone else on a similar path.


What’s Next?
--------------

This is only the beginning.
There’s no grand roadmap or strict publishing schedule — just a commitment to 
writing when I feel I have something worth sharing.

If you’ve stumbled upon this site, welcome! Feel free to read along, take what 
resonates, and leave the rest.

Thanks for visiting.
