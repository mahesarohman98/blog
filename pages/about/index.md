About
======

I'm **Mahesa**, a backend heavy software engineer helping businesses create impactful apps,
seamless online experiences, and scalable systems.

This blog is a space for me to document what I’m learning, share small projects, and write about 
things I care about — whether it’s tooling, development, or just thoughts along the way.

Everything here is:
* **Static** - No Javascript framework or dynamic loading.
* **Minimal** - Just markdown, compiled by a static site generator i built in C, and served with quark.
* **Privacy Respecting** - No analytics, no tracking, no cookies. Just plain content.

I built this blog for myself, but if you're into terminal workflows or want to follow along on my journey - Welcome.

Thanks for visiting.
